# selfcontain

Make HTML more self-contained by in-lining:

 * JavaScript (minified)
 * CSS (minified)
 * Images (base-64 encoded)
     * Including (explicitly linked) favicons

For straightforward cases, this will take an HTML document which might
have external dependencies and return an HTML document with no
external dependencies - a single self-contained file that you could
send as an email attachment, or show as a presentation without
worrying about internet connectivity, for example.

Cases that are *not* straightforward are those that involve loading
things via JavaScript, `iframe`s, fonts, and things I haven't thought
of. Pull requests welcome!


### Usage

Loaded as a module, `selfcontain()` takes an HTML string and is the
main function to know. Command-line usage wraps the minor extension
`selfcontain_ref()`, which takes a string specifying a file path or
URL to fetch and process.

```bash
./selfcontain.py test_in.html > test_out.html
# or
./selfcontain.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajschumacher/selfcontain/master/test_in.html > test_out.html
```
